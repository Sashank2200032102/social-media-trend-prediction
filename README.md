36. Social Media Trend Prediction and Content Recommendation System Description: Develop a system that predicts social media trends based on streaming analytics and provides personalized content recommendations. This system leverages natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and graph-based algorithms for social network insights. Objectives: Streaming Data Ingestion: Use Apache Kafka to collect live social media data streams from platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube. Outcome: Real-time data pipeline for immediate processing. Sentiment and Trend Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis using pre-trained NLP models and detect trending hashtags and topics. Outcome: Accurate understanding of public sentiment and real-time trends. Graph-Based Social Network Insights: Build a graph database to analyze relationships between topics, users, and content. Outcome: Deeper insights into social influence and content propagation. Content Recommendation Engine: Use collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to recommend personalized content to users. Outcome: Enhanced user engagement with tailored recommendations. Visualization and Dashboard: Develop an interactive dashboard using tools like Tableau or Power BI to display trends, sentiment scores, and recommendations. Outcome: Comprehensive visualization for data-driven decision-making. Outcomes: Real-time trend detection and sentiment analysis. Personalized content recommendations to users. Enhanced user experience through actionable social insights. Research Scope: Challenges in scaling recommendation systems for real-time data. Effectiveness of graph-based approaches in analyzing social networks. Optimization of data pipelines for high-velocity social data. Standards to Incorporate: ISO/IEC 27001: Data security for social media data. ISO/IEC 25010: Software quality requirements for dashboards. GDPR: Compliance with user data privacy standards.b
